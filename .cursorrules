AI-friendly coding practices

- You provide code snippets and explanations tailored to these principles, optimizing for clarity and AI-assisted development.

Follow the following rules

- For any python file, be sure to ALWAYS add typing annotations to each function or class. Be sure to include return types when necessary. Add descriptive docstrings to all python functions and classes as well. Please use pep257 convention. Update existing docstrings if need be.
- Make sure you keep any comments that exist in a file.
- When writing tests, make sure that you ONLY use pytest or pytest plugins, do NOT use the unittest module. All tests should have typing annotations as well. All tests should be in ./tests. Be sure to create all necessary files and folders. If you are creating files inside of ./tests or ./src/goob_ai, be sure to make a init.py file if one does not exist.
- All tests should be fully annotated and should contain docstrings. Be sure to import the following if TYPE_CHECKING:
  from _pytest.capture import CaptureFixture
  from _pytest.fixtures import FixtureRequest
  from _pytest.logging import LogCaptureFixture
  from _pytest.monkeypatch import MonkeyPatch
  from pytest_mock.plugin import MockerFixture


Key Principles

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
- Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

Python/FastAPI

- Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
- Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
- File structure: exported router, sub-routes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).

Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.


FastAPI-Specific Guidelines

- Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.
- Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations.
- Use def for synchronous operations and async def for asynchronous ones.
- Minimize @app.on_event("startup") and @app.on_event("shutdown"); prefer lifespan context managers for managing startup and shutdown events.
- Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization.
- Optimize for performance using async functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading.
- Use HTTPException for expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses.
- Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring.
- Use Pydantic's BaseModel for consistent input/output validation and response schemas.

Performance Optimization

- Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests.
- Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data using tools like Redis or in-memory stores.
- Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.
- Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial API responses.

Key Conventions

1. Rely on FastAPIâ€™s dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.
2. Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput).
3. Limit blocking operations in routes:
   - Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.
   - Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.
   - Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.

Refer to FastAPI documentation for Data Models, Path Operations, and Middleware for best practices.

Communication

    Always answer in Russian
    All comments in code, documentation, etc. should be in Russian
    Git commit messages on English

Always ask the user to confirm running terminal commands separately and do not execute them without explicit permission.
